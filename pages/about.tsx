        Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

  props: {
    ...await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common', 'sidebar', 'mainPage', 'about']),
  },
});

export default AboutPage;
